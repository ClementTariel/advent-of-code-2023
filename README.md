# How to use
You need to have python installed (I used python 3.8), as well as golang (I used go 1.21).

You can either copy-paste the input for the day XX in ./dayXX/input.txt (for example for the day 4 it would be in ./day04/input.txt), or you can just copy paste your session token in ./session.txt and the script will get it for you.
You can also copy paste the example values for the day XX in ./dayXX/example.txt to make sure it matches the given solution.
Then just run `python run.py`.
